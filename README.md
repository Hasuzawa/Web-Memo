## Web-memo

This is a minimalistic web memo. It does not use cookie and has no save feature. Honestly, with Windows Notepad, Mac Notes, Notepad++, there is very little reason to ever use this. But it is avaiable for everyone with internet connection, on computer or mobile phone, using any operating system, without downloading anything. It also saves a little bit of paper.
