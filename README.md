## Web Memo

This is a minimalistic Web Memo for writing memo online. It does not use cookie and has no save feature. Honestly, with Windows Notepad, Mac Notes, Notepad++, there is very little reason to ever use this. But it is available for everyone with internet connection, on computer or mobile phone, using any operating system, without downloading anything. It also saves a little bit of paper.

I have set a maximum of 100 memos at one time, but that is not due to technical limitation. Just like real life, you want to keep them organized.

It also has a simple custom 404 page. Try it out!

Tip: You can hold Enter when the add button is flashing to add many memo at once
